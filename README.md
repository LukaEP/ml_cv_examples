# Artificial Intelligence (AI) Examples
This repository shares AI projects that can accomplish some real life tasks. Many concepts from machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV) will be used to find solutions to certain problems.
The idea to create this repo came from studying the concepts of ML and CV, during a course in [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/). The intention is to develop simple projects to put into practice the studied concepts.
